Project for Machine Learning course in Blekinge Institute of Technology.

In this paper it will be discussed different Convolutional Neural Network models for facial expression recognition. Making use
of Fer2013 data set we will be able to detect which expression is in an image.

# More information
There are 4 python executables one for each model.
To be able to run them just type:

>python modelX.py 
(where X can be 1 to 4)

Tensorflow needs to be installed to be able to run it:
https://www.tensorflow.org/install/

As the dataset has a size of 300MB it is not attached.
Once downloaded specify the path to it in the "CSV_FILE" variable. The one used in this paper is: https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge
